**Note**: We follow industry best practices with a clean root directory. Additional internal references are intentionally withheld until stable release.

### Layout Organization (Modernized)
The UI is organized into maintainable, screen-focused KV files with a clear loading order. This approach improves iteration speed and keeps layouts consistent without exposing internal file structure. The modernized setup enables:
- Cleaner diffs and easier collaboration
- Reduced duplication and warnings
- Faster targeted layout updates

### Conditional Navigation System
The app features an intelligent navigation system that creates navigation drawers only for screens that need them:

**Screens WITH Navigation Drawers:**
- Wallet Screen
- Settings Screen  
- Food Tracking Screen
- DEX Trading Screen
- NFT Minting Screen

**Screens WITHOUT Navigation Drawers:**
- Login Screen
- Transaction Screens (Send XRP, Send Tokens)
- Setup/Import Screens
- Intro/First Use Screens
- Mnemonic Display/Verify Screens

### XRPL Multi-Server Failover
Robust connectivity with automatic failover:
1. Primary: `https://testnet.xrpl-labs.com`
2. Backup: `https://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51234`
3. Backup: `https://testnet.xrplapi.com`
4. Backup: `https://xrplcluster.com`

### XRPL Response Caching
Lightweight in-memory caching for select XRPL requests (e.g. `ServerInfo`) reduces redundant network calls and stabilizes performance under intermittent connectivity. Cache entries automatically expire after a short TTL.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Pre-Release Notice)
## ⏳ Deferred Components (Isolated)

The following planned features are isolated under feature flags and excluded from the active beta build:

- **Web3 Browser Screen** (`ENABLE_WEB3_BROWSER=False`): Future in-app browsing / WalletConnect surface.
- **CalorieDB Sync Layer** (`ENABLE_CALORIE_DB=False`): Planned decentralized product scan indexing (IPFS + BigchainDB).
 - **XRPL ↔ CalorieDB Sync Service** (`ENABLE_CALORIE_DB=False`): Real-time bidirectional sync deferred; heavy integration code isolated.

They reside in `src/_deferred/` and can be re-enabled via flags once scoped for a release milestone.


Runtime/build commands have been deliberately removed (v1.1.2) to prevent distribution of unfinished work. Request internal access: info@calorietoken.net.

### Key Components

- **`XRPLClientManager`**: Handles XRPL connectivity with automatic failover
- **`ConditionalNavigationDrawer`**: Intelligent navigation system
- **`PasswordFieldWithToggle`**: Enhanced password input with visibility toggle
- **`robust_submit_and_wait`**: Transaction submission with retry logic

### Development Viewport & Responsive Overrides
During active development and automated UX tours we often want a consistent, phone-sized viewport while still preserving full adaptive behavior for tablets and desktops in production.

Environment overrides (all optional):

| Variable | Example | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DEV_PHONE_VIEWPORT` | `390x844` | Forces window size (if `APP_FORCE_WIDTH/HEIGHT` not set) to a modern phone logical resolution (portrait enforced). |
| `FORCE_SIZE_CLASS` | `sm` / `phone` | Pins responsive size class regardless of window width (use `phone` as alias for `sm`). |
| `TOUR_FORCE_PHONE` | `1` | In UX tour runs auto-sets `DEV_PHONE_VIEWPORT=390x844` and `FORCE_SIZE_CLASS=sm` if unset. |
| `TOUR_PHONE_WIDTH` / `TOUR_PHONE_HEIGHT` | `414` / `896` | Fine-grained control for UX tour window size when `TOUR_FORCE_PHONE` is enabled. |

Example (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:DEV_PHONE_VIEWPORT="390x844"; $env:FORCE_SIZE_CLASS="sm"; python -B scripts/complete_ux_tour.py
```

Production builds simply omit these variables and the app reverts to automatic breakpoint detection (`xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`). The responsive system caches scaling factors to minimize recomputation while keeping layout adjustments correct on window resize.

Breakpoints remain unchanged ensuring cross-platform compatibility; overrides are strictly opt-in for development convenience.

### Debug Overlay (Development Only)
Activation mechanics exist but invocation commands are withheld pre-release. Overlay shows breakpoint class, scaling factors, and dimensions when enabled internally.

This displays a small badge in the top-right corner showing:
- Current size class (xs/sm/md/lg/xl)
- Lock icon (🔒) when `FORCE_SIZE_CLASS` is active
- DP and font scale factors
- Current window dimensions

The overlay updates in real-time during window resizes and is automatically removed in production (when `DEBUG_RESPONSIVE` is unset).

### CI Testing Strategy
Automated UX validation runs are supported to help catch regressions across device sizes. Details of internal test tooling are intentionally minimized here for security and competitive reasons. See `docs/UX_TOUR_GUIDE.md` for a public overview of the process.

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated UX Tour
We use an automated UX tour to validate major screens and flows and to generate visual reports for review. High-level, public-safe documentation is available here:

- [UX Tour Guide](docs/UX_TOUR_GUIDE.md)

Implementation details and internal scripts are withheld to protect the project’s integrity until formal release.
