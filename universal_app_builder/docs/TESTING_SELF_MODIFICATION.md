# Self-Modification Testing Framework (Spec Stub)

**Status:** SPEC-STUB | Implementation Missing

## Intended Layers
1. Syntax validation
2. Static security pattern scan
3. Sandbox execution (controlled environment)
4. Integration workflow test (dry-run generation)
5. Rollback trigger on failure

## Phase 1 Rebuild Priority
Recreate syntax validator + rollback safety before any automated file mutation.

## Deferred
- Dynamic taint analysis
- Multi-process isolation

## Recovery Disclaimer
Original detailed guide lost. This stub records layered approach for later expansion.
