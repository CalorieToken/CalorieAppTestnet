# UAB Documentation Index (Reconstructed)

This index lists placeholder specification documents recovered conceptually. Original authored content was removed and not tracked in git.

## Documents
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` – High-level system overview and component map.
2. `FEATURE_DSL_SPEC.md` – Intended declarative feature description language.
3. `ETHICAL_USAGE.md` – Service usage constraints and abuse prevention goals.
4. `TESTING_SELF_MODIFICATION.md` – Multi-layer safety testing design.
5. `RECOVERY_PLAN.md` – Phased reconstruction strategy.

## Legend
- Status: `PLANNED` (no implementation), `SPEC-STUB` (placeholder), `ACTIVE` (implemented later)
- Each spec includes: Purpose, Scope, Out-of-Scope, Future Risks.

## Next Steps
1. Approve recovery scope.
2. Fill each stub with detailed restored content (from memory / prior notes).
3. Begin Phase 1 (see recovery plan) when ready.

## Disclaimer
This index replaces a previously more complete documentation set that was not preserved in version control. Rebuild will be incremental and transparent.
