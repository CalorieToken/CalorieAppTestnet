# PR: Merge chore/repo-hardening into main (Comprehensive Backup & Hardening)

## Overview
This pull request merges the `chore/repo-hardening` branch, capturing a full backup of current application state, extensive UX/UI improvements, legal/trademark hardening, documentation upgrades, automation tooling, and scaffolding for upcoming decentralized + nutritional feature sets.

## Key Themes
- UX Consistency & Accessibility
- Security & Privacy Hardening
- Documentation Public-Safe Index + Social Automation
- Future Feature Foundations (CalorieDB, Wallet Connect, Performance)
- Legal Protection (Trademark, License hygiene)

## Highlights
### 1. UX / UI Improvements
- Updated 24+ KV layout files for consistent text wrapping (`text_size` usage) and spacing.
- Navigation/back button sizing harmonized across onboarding and wallet flows.
- Enhanced Wallet, Mnemonic verification, DEX, NFT mint, Settings screens.
- Added new scanning/browser screens: Barcode, Camera, Web3, WebView.

### 2. New Utility & Feature Foundations
- CalorieDB encryption, linking, sync scaffolding.
- FoodRepo integration clients and future data ingestion path.
- Wallet Connect preliminary connectors (Xaman integration groundwork).
- Performance tools: caching, debounce, resource guard.
- Security enhancements: clipboard auto-clear, encryption modules.
- Accessibility/responsive frameworks for adaptive UI.

### 3. Documentation & Legal
- `OFFICIAL_PROJECT_DOCS.md` as public-safe canonical index.
- Updated `README.md` & `docs/README.md` to remove sensitive internal references.
- `TRADEMARK.md` and enhanced `LICENSE` treatment for CalorieToken®.
- Iteration milestone & status docs (e.g., `STATUS_UPDATE_2025-11-18.md`).
- Social posting system: visual concepts, platform post templates, automation scripts.

### 4. Automation Tooling
- `tools/generate_social_posts.ps1` – Generate platform-specific text.
- `tools/copy_social_post.ps1` – Quick clipboard with image recommendations.
- `tools/prepare_public_commit.ps1` – Curated public-safe staging.
- `tools/check_social_assets.ps1` – Verifies presence of required image assets.

### 5. Privacy & Exclusions
Sensitive or unfinished competitive implementation documents remain excluded via `.gitignore` (architecture internals, deep test artifacts, roadmap explorations). Public-facing docs sanitized to avoid leakage of proprietary flows.

## File Change Summary
- Added: Automation scripts, utility modules, new screens, docs/posts assets, trademark doc, funding config.
- Modified: Core app module, multiple KV layouts, screen controllers, metadata (`setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`).
- Created scaffolding for image assets in `assets/social-media/2025-11-18-docs-update/`.

## Risk Assessment
| Area | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| KV Layout Changes | Minor visual regressions | Manual smoke test on primary flows |
| New Utility Modules | Latent runtime bugs | Feature flags & staged rollout planned |
| CalorieDB / Wallet Connect | Unfinished integration confusion | Clear separation; docs exclude deep internals |
| Social Automation Scripts | Platform change drift | Modular, easily editable scripts |

## Follow-Up (Post Merge)
1. Generate & commit finalized visual assets (PNG set) for announcement.
2. Run extended regression & UX tactile testing.
3. Initiate beta release packaging (Buildozer / platform packaging review).
4. Implement staged activation of CalorieDB sync & Wallet Connect connectors.
5. Prepare localization/internationalization foundation.

## Merge Strategy
Use a standard squash or fast-forward merge. Retain detailed commit messages for historical/legal trace. Tag next release candidate after visuals: `v1.1.2-rc1`.

## Requested Reviewer Focus
- Confirm no sensitive internal docs leaked.
- Sanity check KV layout consistency.
- Review new utility module naming & placement.
- Validate trademark usage consistency.

## Checklist
- [x] Public-safe docs verified
- [x] Trademark & license updated
- [x] Social automation working locally
- [x] Scripts executable on Windows PowerShell
- [x] Branch rebased (if needed) – to confirm before merge
