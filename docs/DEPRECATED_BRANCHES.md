# Deprecated Branches

The following branches are now marked as DEPRECATED and should not be used for new work. They are retained temporarily for historical reference and may be deleted after archival.

| Branch | Status | Replacement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `chore/repo-hardening` | Deprecated (merged) | `main` |
| `CalorieAppV11-2` | Deprecated (legacy iteration) | `main` |
| `CalorieAppV11-3` | Deprecated (legacy iteration) | `main` |

Active development branches:
- `main` (canonical)
- `feature/visual-refinement-v1.1.2` (current visual + social asset refinements)

Policy:
- No new commits should land on deprecated branches.
- Open PRs (if any) should be closed or retargeted to `main`.
- Automated tooling and CI should ignore deprecated branches.
