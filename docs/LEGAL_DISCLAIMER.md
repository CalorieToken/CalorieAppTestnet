# CalorieApp Extended Legal & Beta Testnet Disclaimer

Revision: 2025-11-19 (v1.1.2)
Canonical Path: `docs/LEGAL_DISCLAIMER.md`

---
## 1. Experimental Status
CalorieApp (the "Software") is pre-release beta software operating solely on the XRP Ledger Testnet. All features (wallets, token handling, NFT, DEX, food tracking, UI components, internal APIs) are experimental and may be modified, suspended, or removed without notice prior to any mainnet launch.

## 2. No Real-World Value
Testnet XRP and any Testnet representations or units of CalorieToken ($CAL) possess no monetary, redeemable, exchangeable, or transferable real-world value. They are intended exclusively for development and testing.

## 3. No Financial / Investment / Health / Legal Advice
Nothing in the source code, documentation, commit history, issues, discussions, artifacts, generated images, interfaces, or related materials constitutes financial, investment, legal, medical, dietary, tax, or other regulated advice. Users must perform independent due diligence.

## 4. No Solicitation
This repository does **not** solicit investment, purchase of tokens, securities, or other financial instruments. References to the CalorieToken issuer address are purely descriptive for technical integration.

## 5. Assumption of Risk
You assume all risks associated with downloading, compiling, executing, or interacting with beta code, including (without limitation): data loss, corrupted storage, inaccurate balances, failed transactions, performance degradation, network outages, security defects, or incompatibilities.

## 6. Provided "AS IS" / No Warranty
The Software is provided "AS IS" without any warranties—express or implied—including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, reliability, or availability. No guarantee of future feature inclusion, uptime, or performance characteristics is made.

## 7. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall CalorieToken, contributors, maintainers, affiliates, or licensors be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages (including but not limited to loss of funds, data, goodwill, profits, or use) arising out of or in connection with use of or inability to use the Software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 8. Intellectual Property & Trademarks
CalorieToken® trademarks, logos, and branding are protected assets. See `docs/TRADEMARK.md` for permitted usage. No trademark or branding rights are granted beyond what is explicitly outlined. The Custom Dual License governs code usage—not trademark rights.

## 9. Data Handling & Local Security
Sensitive wallet materials (keys, mnemonics, passwords) are stored locally (encrypted where implemented). No custody, key escrow, or managed backup services are provided. You are solely responsible for safeguarding exported or stored credentials.

## 10. Security Posture
Although reasonable hardening efforts are pursued, the Software has **not** undergone formal third-party penetration testing or security audits at this beta stage. Treat all cryptographic and transactional operations as provisional.

## 11. Forward-Looking Statements
Roadmap items, planned features, performance goals, scaling targets, and future compatibility claims are forward-looking and inherently uncertain. Actual outcomes may differ materially from stated intentions.

## 12. Regulatory & Jurisdictional Compliance
You are responsible for ensuring that use of the Software complies with all laws, regulations, and restrictions applicable in your jurisdiction. If local rules prohibit interaction with beta blockchain software or test tokens, discontinue use immediately.

## 13. Contributions & Public Disclosure
Pull requests, issues, discussions, and submitted artifacts may become publicly visible. Do **not** submit proprietary, trade secret, personal, or confidential information. By contributing you grant necessary rights for project maintenance and publication under the repository’s license.

## 14. Licensing Interaction
Code usage is governed by the Custom Dual License (`LICENSE`). Commercial or public distribution beyond personal/educational scope requires written permission (info@calorietoken.net). This disclaimer supplements (does not supersede) the license terms.

## 15. Monitoring & Transparency
Development transparency is provided through public commits, branches, tags, and release notes at: https://github.com/CalorieToken/CalorieAppTestnet. No guarantee is made that historical versions will remain available.

## 16. Third-Party Dependencies
Third-party libraries and tools are subject to their own licenses and risks. CalorieToken and contributors disclaim responsibility for vulnerabilities or defects originating from external dependencies.

## 17. Export / Sanctions Compliance
You must ensure compliance with export controls and sanctions regimes (e.g., EU, US, UN listings). No representation is made regarding suitability for use in embargoed or restricted territories.

## 18. Automated Scripts / Build Artifacts
Any build scripts, automation tooling, generated assets, or CI outputs are auxiliary and provided without warranty. Generated APKs or binaries (if produced) are strictly test artifacts and not certified for production deployment.

## 19. High-Risk Use Prohibition
The Software is not designed or intended for use in safety-critical, medical, life support, emergency response, nuclear, aviation, or regulated financial infrastructure contexts. Such use is expressly disclaimed.

## 20. Acceptance
Accessing, cloning, building, executing, or contributing to the repository constitutes acceptance of all clauses herein. If you disagree with any section, you must cease use and remove all copies.
