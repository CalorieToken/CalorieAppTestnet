Title: feat: visual refinement kickoff (v1.1.2 prep)

Summary
Initiates v1.1.2 cycle focusing on visual consistency, accessibility, and performance baselining. Adds audit checklist and long-form release context.

Included
- `docs/VISUAL_AUDIT_CHECKLIST_v1.1.2.md` – structured refinement & measurement checklist.
- `docs/LINKEDIN_ARTICLE_v1.1.1_RELEASE.md` – long-form public release / context.
- `docs/ROADMAP_v1.1.2.md` – goals for upcoming iteration (already present).
- `docs/RELEASE_BODY_v1.1.1.md` – reproducible release body (already present).

Why
Pre-defining visual and performance criteria reduces ambiguity and accelerates polish tasks. Article supports community transparency.

Next Steps (Post-Merge)
1. Add design tokens module (spacing, elevation scale).
2. Normalize KV layout spacing + remove inline hacks.
3. Profile render time & FPS for heavy screens.
4. Contrast + focus accessibility pass.
5. Begin early CalorieDB activation scaffolding.

Review Checklist
- [ ] Files match intent & naming.
- [ ] No unrelated code changes.
- [ ] Documentation renders correctly.
- [ ] Roadmap aligns with release article messaging.
